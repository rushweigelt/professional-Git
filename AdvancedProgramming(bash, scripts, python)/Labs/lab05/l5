1.1 The comments/definitions are extraneous, as true and false carry those definitions by default in Unix.

1.2 int smaller(char *val1, char *val2) {
	#strcmp is a comparision function in C
	if (strcmp(val1, val2) < 1)
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;

1.3 Trying to articulate it aloud is even more nauseating than reading it. 

1.4 
a) if (c != 'y' || c!= 'Y' )
	return;

b) if (length < Bufsize)
	length = Bufsize;

c)  flag != flag

d) quote=1;
   if (*line == '"')
	quote=0;

e) bit = (val & 1) ? 1 : 0;

1.5 the two lines in the function are redundant.

1.6 
1 1
1 2
2 2
3 1
1 3

1.7 
a) if ! (istty(stdin) || istty(stdout) || istty(stderr))
	  	return 0;

b) if (retval != SUCCESS)
	return (retval)	;
   else
	return SUCCESS;

c) for (k=0; k < 5; k++; x += dx)
	scanf("%lf", &dx);

1.8 for (i=0; i<total; i++) {
	if (this.getName(i) == nametable.userName()) {
		retrun (0) ;
	}
    }

1.9 variable c isnt properly isolated with parenthesis, so it could be executed out of order/multiple times.

1.10 
#define feetToMeter 0.3048
#define meterToFoot 3.28084
#define milesToFeet 5280.0
#define milesToKilomtrs 1.609344
#define sqrMilesToSqrKilomtrs 2.589988

1.11
a) comment should come before call, not after

b) test that n is greater than MAX OR that n is odd

c) first comment is redundent due to the functions name being self explanatory
 the body comments (increments) are confusing because it claims to do the same thing, despite different variables being involved on the lines after the comments.
